An online voting system is a software platform that allows groups to securely conduct votes and elections. Such systems balance security, accessibility, and the overall requirements of an organization's voting event. Electronic voting technology intends to speed up the counting of ballots, reduce the cost of paying staff to count votes manually, and can provide improved accessibility for disabled voters. Results can be reported and published faster.

At their core, online voting systems protect the integrity of your vote by preventing voters from being able to vote multiple times. As a digital platform, they eliminate the need to gather in-person, cast votes using paper, or by any other means (e.g. email, insecure survey software). The confidence in your voting and election results is by far the most valuable aspect that online voting systems can offer. The fallout of a vote being perceived as unfair is expensive, time-consuming, and wreaks havoc on the hard-earned trust that has been built among people. From this perspective, an online voting system offers unparalleled election security and is comprehensible.
